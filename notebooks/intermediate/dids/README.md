- [What are Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWgAgpfLEIQ)
> Similar to email address or phone number as it's globally unique and you can proove that you own one.
> Difference is you entirely control the identifier once it's created
    - Private Key/Public Key Cryptography
    - The owner knows the private key
    - The public key is known to the public

- [Decentralized identity explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ew-_F-OtDFI)
> We need digital identifiers that individual can own independently of any entity or organization.
> public key is stored in distributed ledger (i.e., blockchain)
