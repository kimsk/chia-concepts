- [What are Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWgAgpfLEIQ)
> Similar to email address or phone number as it's globally unique and you can proove that you own one.

> Difference is you entirely control the identifier once it's created
>    - Private Key/Public Key Cryptography
>    - The owner knows the private key
>    - The public key is known to the public

- [Decentralized identity explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ew-_F-OtDFI)
> We need digital identifiers that individual can own independently of any entity or organization.

> public key is stored in distributed ledger (i.e., blockchain)

> a decentralized identifier (DID) is simply a new type of globally unique identifier.

> UUIDs are not globally resolvable and URNs – if resolvable – require a centralized registration authority. In addition, neither UUIDs or URNs inherently address a third characteristic – the ability to cryptographically verify ownership of the identifier.

> DID infrastructure can be thought of as a global key-value database in which the database is all DID-compatible blockchains, distributed ledgers, or decentralized networks.
