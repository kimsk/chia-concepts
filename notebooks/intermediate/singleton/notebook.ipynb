    "# What Is Singleton?\n",
    "\n",
    "> **A singleton is an identity which is embodied by exactly one coin** at any given time, and where it’s possible for coins to validate that they’re interacting with the current representative of that identity. It’s similar to, but simpler than, coloured coins. An NFT is barely more than a raw singleton. Singletons are also the foundation of rate limited wallets, distributed identities, pool protocol, and price oracles. -- [A Vision for DeFi in Chia](https://www.chia.net/2021/07/13/a-vision-for-defi-in-chia.en.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "> **A singleton is a coin that is verifiably unique**. Similar to (but more powerful than) NFTs, a singleton cannot be copied, duplicated, or recreated if it is destroyed. It is a common outer puzzle for things like DIDs, NFTs, or the pooling protocol. -- [The Great Chia Glossary | Singleton](https://chialisp.com/docs/glossary)\n",
    "\n",
    "> **A singleton is a special kind of puzzle that asserts uniqueness**, preventing other coins from being mistaken for it. It can change state over time, each time creating a new puzzle based on the previous. It wraps an `inner puzzle` which can have whatever behavior you desire. These traits combined allow for smart contracts and things like NFTs to be created. -- [What is a singleton?](https://developers.chia.net/t/what-is-a-singleton/87)"

    "## Why Do We Need Singleton?\n",
    "> Coins on the network are state, the puzzle is the data contained within them. You can spend them to change their state however you like, by creating new coins. This is what singletons excel at. -- [Can you store state on the network?](https://developers.chia.net/t/can-you-store-state-on-the-network/84)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the account model (e.g, Ethereum), you have **a unique contract address** that you can access and update data. In the coin set model, however, coins are state, so we need to be able to extract state that we are interested from those coins somehow. To update those states, we will need to spend them and create new coins. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Coin Id & Puzzle Hash\n",
    "Each coin has a unique [coin_id](../../basic/coins/notebook.ipynb) which derived from `parent_coin_id`, `puzzle_hash`, and its `amount` (in mojos). \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you spend the coin with the existing state, you could get a new unspent coin with the new state (different or same puzzle hash). However, this means that you have to keep track of a valid `coin_id` and/or `puzzle hash`. In addition, someone can just create new coins with the same puzzle hash out of nowhere which could be more confusing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A Singleton Puzzle & Launcher Id\n",
    "It's clear that we need a way to model the idea of **unique id**, so the Chia Network comes up with [singleton puzzle](https://chialisp.com/docs/puzzles/singletons). **A singleton coin provides a unique id called launcher id that can be used as the permanent unique address.** The `launcher id` is basically the `coin_id` of the launcher coin that creates the first singleton coin. When a singleton coin is spent, at most one new singleton coin can be created. We can always track all of those singleton coins and find the unspent singleton coin by following the `launcher id`.\n"
